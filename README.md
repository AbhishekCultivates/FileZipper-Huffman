# File Zipper | Huffman

This web application demonstrates the working principles of Huffman encoding and decoding for text files (.txt). It allows users to compress and decompress files with a simple and interactive user interface, showing how file zippers work for efficient text file compression.

## Features

- **File Upload**: Users can upload `.txt` files for encoding or decoding.
- **Huffman Encoding & Decoding**: Implemented with a human-readable algorithm for compressing and decompressing text.
- **Tree Visualization**: The application displays the Huffman tree used in the encoding process.
- **File Download**: Encoded and decoded files can be easily downloaded after processing.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Handles Huffman encoding and decoding logic.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web interface.
- **FileReader API**: Reads user-uploaded text files.
- **Huffman Algorithm**: Efficient binary heap-based algorithm for file compression.

## How to Use

1. Upload a `.txt` file.
2. Click on "Encode" to compress the file or "Decode" to decompress it.
3. Download the processed file.

## Future Improvements

- Add support for other file types.
- Improve tree visualization.
- Implement a detailed progress bar for larger files.
